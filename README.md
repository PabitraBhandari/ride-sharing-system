This repository contains a Ride Sharing System implemented in two languages:

- `cpp/` – C++ implementation using object-oriented design
- `smalltalk/` – Smalltalk (Pharo 12) implementation

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to demonstrate key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts:

- **Encapsulation**
- **Inheritance**
- **Polymorphism**

Each implementation showcases these principles in the context of a ride-sharing system that includes rides, drivers, and riders.
